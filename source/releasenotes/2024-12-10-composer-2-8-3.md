Composer 2.8.3 is now available on Pantheon as of December 10, 2024.

### No action required

Composer 2.8.3 will slowly roll out to all Integrated Composer sites on Pantheon automatically. There is no action required on your part.

### Breaking changes

There is one potentially breaking change added in [2.8.0](https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.8.0) that developers should be aware of. The fallback behavior of `https_proxy` to `http_proxy` has been removed as previously warned in [2.7.3](https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.7.3).

### Highlights

Between versions 2.7.7 and 2.8.3, Composer introduced several enhancements, including the `--patch-only` flag for the `update` command to restrict updates to patch versions and improved interactive package update selection with better package display. A key improvement was adding JSON schema validation for `composer.lock` files. Updates also addressed PHP 8.4 compatibility and resolved issues with provider suggestions and lock file schemas.
